## :label: The problem ECOVILLA solves
Explaination: A step for healing our mother nature.
We strongly believe in protecting our holy Rivers and preserve their Pureness.
Basically focused on 2 topics i.e river protection and paper recycling.

Through this apps feature of River protection and Paper recycling it collects data such as factors defining the purity of the river (TDS,Transparency etc). Data regarding the purity of the river can be monitored in real time and this data can be very useful to the Ministry of Drinking water and sanitation to keep a track of the water bodies and prevent pollution. These measurements can also be used to graph changes in the quality of water and pre-empt water borne diseases. In addition to this Eco Villa also provides the feature of collecting scrap from organisations to be converted to recycled products.
Provided a customized panel for corporate offices and institutional organizations producing the bulk of the paper waste. They can tie-up with us to get rid of their scrap and add value to that material.Here, the data of the kind of scrap available and the location of pick up can be captured and put on a sort of marketplace where buyers can find their nearest source of raw material.
